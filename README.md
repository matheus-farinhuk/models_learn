# Machine Learning Models Learning Package

## Overview

This repository contains a learning package for Machine Learning models implemented primarily using NumPy. The models are implemented in their basic form to facilitate learning and understanding of machine learning concepts. Many of these methods draw inspiration from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".

The project is structured in a modular fashion, aiming to provide clear, understandable implementations that enhance knowledge of NumPy and Python in general.

## Features

- Basic implementations of Machine Learning models using NumPy.
- Inspired by practical examples from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".
- Modular approach for easy understanding and learning.
- Designed to enhance proficiency in NumPy and Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with this package, clone the repository and explore the various modules containing implementations of different machine learning models.

```bash
